# reviews-scrapping
In this project, we build an application that scraps data from Flipkart website. For any given product we scrap the reviews, the rating, the headings and the names of the people who gave those informations about the product. We have made a user interface where a user can send a request about a particular product and get the informations about that product itself. The data scrapped is dumped in a MongoDb database so that whenever a user needs informations about a product the application is going to check whether the data is available in the database or not before searching in the website.
